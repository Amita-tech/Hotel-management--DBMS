HOTEL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM The main purpose of the Online Hotel Management System project is to provide information on the hotel as well as on-line booking room facilities. In the existing system (i.e. the Manual System), a person must go to the hotel to book, inquire, etc. or another option is a phone booking.
